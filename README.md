# zshrc-backup


My zsh config backup

This is my zsh config backup. It includes youtube-dl, and it also inclues autocomplete, and auto-suggestions. 
It also has my ascii-art (ï£¿ by default) To install it, just copy all files to the $HOME folder. 
Also, please change userName to your username and password to your password (without quotes)
Then rename zshrc file to .zshrc (as it's hidden). I believe it works on any LINUX/UNIX based system, having zsh as their shell.
